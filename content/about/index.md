## Experience
### Lighting Technician for BYU OIT AV Productions

I gained and applied understanding of technical lighting equipment including professional lighting control and programming environments. I also worked closely with others to make decisions and accomplish tasks requiring organization of up to 100 lighting fixtures. I also contributed to high profile events such as BYU Devotionals and gained confidence under time and quality constraints.

In addition to maintaining the BYU Marching Band's Website and posting news updates, I worked with the band staff to rebuild the site to match BYU branding and accessability requirements. This required building a WordPress theme, HTML, CSS, PHP and all, to fit the band's needs.

### Computer Systems Teaching Assistant

Being a Teaching Assistant, I taught concepts and applications of computer systems in classroom and one-on-one scenarios. Doing this expanded my knowledge of binary logic, assembly, and C. I also worked with instructors and other teaching assistants to oversee assignment grading for over 100 students by using Linux shell scripts to validate student code.
