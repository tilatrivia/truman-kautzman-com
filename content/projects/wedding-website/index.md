## Why Make Your Own Wedding Website?

These days, many engaged couples use a website to get the word out about their weddings. My then my fiance Jessica and I definitely needed a website ourselves. We were holding three events all over the country and creating multiple registries. We needed to keep all the details straight for everyone who would be participating.

There are many no-code tools specifically for wedding websites, and many will even sell themed invitations too. They are easy to use and well optimized for the use case. They also tend to be very formal and impersonal. This wasn't entirely what we were going for and I knew I had the skill to make something unique and special for us.

## What We Made

The design process began with picking colors. My fiance loves, bold cool colors. Her desire was to use chartreuse. We entertained this idea and tried to make a pallette of cools including chartreuse work. Eventually, we found that it was going to be very difficult to color an entire wedding around chartreuse, especially dresses and complimentary suits. We eventually moved to a forest green, dark blue, and lavender pallette, with hints of red.

It was then time to design our cakes! We found a good baker in town and it was time to submit designs to them. We brainstormed for a little bit and settled on just a few key elements to include. Two love birds on the top sitting in branches with lavender flowers around, a few mushrooms in moss, and a frog on a lilly pad in a lake. Lots of fun, cute ideas. It would have been a lot to work in, but we fortunately were going to have several separate tiers to accommodate various allergies anyways.

I decided it would be good to send a visual aid along with our description so I opened up my SVG editor of choice, Boxy SVG, and made up the cakes there. The designs were so cute and fun we used them for all of our wedding materials anyways. The invitation, the website, even the labels at the reception.

## The Result

    {{< carousel-image src="wedding-cake-design.png" title="Our original wedding cake design." >}}
    {{< carousel-image src="wedding-cupcake-design.png" title="The cupcake designs we ultimately sent to the baker." >}}
    {{< carousel-image src="wedding-cake-reception.jpg" title="The final cupcakes at our reception." >}}

    {{< carousel-image src="wedding-website-banner.png" title="A banner from the wedding website." >}}

We are very happy with the results. Combined with our awesome engagement photos taken by [Brynlee Barker](https://www.bybryn.com/) the website and cards turned out awesome and they preceded a wonderful wedding and reception! It was really special for me to be able to make the materials for our wedding. It may not be anything crazy, but it is fun, cute, and ours. The frog has even become our unofficial logo!

## How It Was Made

The many graphical elements are SVGs made with Boxy SVG. The website was built with raw HTML and the styling was done with Tailwind CSS. The site is deployed to Google Firebase Hosting.
