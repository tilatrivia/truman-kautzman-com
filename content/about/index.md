## Experience
### Lighting Technician for BYU OIT AV Productions
*Fall 2017 to Present*

In this job I gained and applied understanding of technical lighting equipment including professional lighting control and programming environments. I also worked closely with others to make decisions and accomplish tasks of various sizes. I also contributed to high profile events such as BYU Devotionals and gained confidence under time and quality constraints.

### Website Secretary for BYU Cougar Marching Band
*Winter 2021 to Present*

In addition to maintaining the BYU Marching Band's Website and posting news updates, I worked with the band staff to rebuild the site to match BYU branding and accessability requirements. This required building a WordPress theme, HTML, CSS, PHP and all, to fit the band's needs.

### Computer Systems Teaching Assistant
*Winter 2020*

Being a Teaching Assistant, I taught concepts and applications of computer systems in classroom and one-on-one scenarios. Doing this expanded knowledge of binary logic, assembly, and C. I also worked with instructors and other teaching assistants to oversee assignment grading including using Linux shell scripts to validate student code.

## Education
### Pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science

Courses so far include web development, data structures, discrete math, computer systems, computational theory, user experience design, and software engineering. Other classes include those in music and religion.
