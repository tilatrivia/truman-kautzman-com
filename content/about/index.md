## Education

{{< box
    title="Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science" 
    subtitle="Brigham Young University - Provo, UT - April 2023" 
    class="bg-blue-light mt-4" >}}
Course work included web development, data structures, discrete math, computer systems, computational theory, user experience design, and software engineering. Software engineering gave me exposure and practice with dozens of technologies and tools as well as practical application of software engineering principals. Other classes include those in music and religion.

## Experience

{{< box
    title="Associate Software Engineer"
    subtitle="Imagine Learning - Remote - May 2023 to Present"
    class="bg-gray-light mt-4"
>}}
As my first exposure to industry software production, I was exposed to large-scale software challenges and solutions, scalability and cost considerations, and Agile development practices. I became familiar with working on a team to divide and conquer and deliver business value. Here I wrote several production React TypeScript components and Kotlin Micronaut endpoints.

{{< box
    title="Lighting Technician"
    subtitle="BYU OIT AV Productions - Provo, UT - August 2017 to December 2023"
    class="bg-gray-light mt-8"
>}}
Here I gained and applied understanding of technical lighting equipment including professional lighting control and programming environments. I also worked closely with others to make decisions and accomplish tasks requiring organization of up to 100 lighting fixtures. I also contributed to high profile events such as BYU Devotionals and gained confidence under time and quality constraints.

{{< box
    title="Software Engineer"
    subtitle="Velaflame Capstone Project - Provo, UT - August 2022 to April 2023"
    class="bg-gray-light mt-8"
>}}
This opportunity was part of my degree program and provided a project that myself and four other students could focus on for several months. Half of the project involved writing C++ Arduino code to communicate with ESP Rainmaker, an IoT backend service from Espressif. The other half was building an app for iOS and Android, so naturally we chose to use Flutter. We were able to deliver business value.

{{< box 
    title="Wordpress Website Developer"
    subtitle="BYU Cougar Marching Band - Provo, UT - January 2021 to April 2023"
    class="bg-gray-light mt-8" 
>}}
In order to meet university accessability and brand requirements, I was brought on to build a Wordpress theme to meet these requirements. To accomplish this I needed to understand the accessability and brand requirements as well as meet the needs and expectations of the band staff. This work itself required building a WordPress theme, HTML, CSS, PHP and all.

{{< box 
    title="Computer Systems Teaching Assistant"
    subtitle="BYU Computer Science Department - Provo, UT - Winter 2020"
    class="bg-gray-light mt-8" 
>}}
As a Teaching Assistant, I taught concepts and applications of computer systems in classroom and one-on-one scenarios. Through teaching others, this expanded my knowledge of binary logic, assembly, and C. I also worked with instructors and other teaching assistants to oversee assignment grading for over 100 students by using Linux shell scripts to validate student code.

## How I Work
My approach to a project focuses on quality and considerate decision making. I am diligent in seeking the best solutions to important problems. What follows are the principles I use to approach the problem-solving process.

{{< columns-4 >}}

    {{< box title="User Experience Design" class="bg-blue-light" >}}
    Design refines the near endless possibilities of computing into optimal solutions. I believe software can compliment and enhance many processes, removing the rote and leaving the creative and inventive tasks for people.
    {{< /box >}}

    {{< box title="Seeing the Big Picture" class="bg-green-light" >}}
    I approach any problem with the overarching goals at the forefront of my mind. Seeking solutions that satisfy not just short term goals, but those related to the larger impacts and ambitions of a project.

    {{< box title="Refining the Smaller Details" class="bg-gray-light" >}}
    Crossing 't's and dotting 'i's may not be most people's idea of fun, but I find tackling the minutia very satisfying as they often add up to having a large impact on the whole product.
    {{< /box >}}

    {{< box title="Communicating Complexity" class="bg-blue-light" >}}
    Technical topics are not easy to talk about and decision making is a tough task. I can explain complex subjects with clarity and simplicity, allowing all involved to have a better picture of the relevant problems and solutions.

## What I Work On
I am a curious person and have many wide ranging interests and am sure to have many more. I like to learn and appreciate the world around us and what we create for it. The following are sampling of more specific things that I enjoy learning about and participating in.

{{< columns-3 >}}

    {{< box title="Music" class="bg-gray-light" >}}
    I have played the French horn for 12 years. I love contributing to an ensemble of musicians, from quintets to marching bands, and admiring what beauty many can come together to accomplish. I also dabble in music composition (ask me about music notation software) and marching drill writing. (However, I don't have a ton of positives about drill writing software)
    {{< /box >}}

    {{< box title="Event Lighting" class="bg-blue-light" >}}
    For several years, I have had the opportunity to contribute to events large and small by lighting them. I have loved learning the intricacies of the technology and art of lighting. I've found a knack for lighting control software and love speculating about what is happening under the hood.
    {{< /box >}}

    {{< box title="The Built Environment" class="bg-green-light" >}}
    I really admire the things we have built and invented for our use. Architecture, urban planning, civil engineering, and transportation fascinate me with their complex problems and genius solutions. I find designing interiors, layouts, roads, and transport networks a fun challenge.
