## Experience
### Lighting Technician for BYU OIT AV Productions
*August 2017 to Present*

I gained and applied understanding of technical lighting equipment including professional lighting control and programming environments. I also worked closely with others to make decisions and accomplish tasks requiring organization of up to 100 lighting fixtures. I also contributed to high profile events such as BYU Devotionals and gained confidence under time and quality constraints.

### Website Secretary for BYU Cougar Marching Band
*January 2021 to Present*

In addition to maintaining the BYU Marching Band's Website and posting news updates, I worked with the band staff to rebuild the site to match BYU branding and accessability requirements. This required building a WordPress theme, HTML, CSS, PHP and all, to fit the band's needs.

### Computer Systems Teaching Assistant
*Winter 2020*

Being a Teaching Assistant, I taught concepts and applications of computer systems in classroom and one-on-one scenarios. Doing this expanded my knowledge of binary logic, assembly, and C. I also worked with instructors and other teaching assistants to oversee assignment grading for over 100 students by using Linux shell scripts to validate student code.

## How I Work
My approach to a project focuses on quality and considerate decision making. I am diligent in seeking the best solutions to important problems. What follows are the principles I use to approach the problem-solving process.

Design refines the near endless possibilities of computing into optimal solutions. I believe software can compliment and enhance many processes, removing the rote and leaving the creative and inventive tasks for people.

Crossing 't's and dotting 'i's may not be most people's idea of fun, but I find tackling the minutia very satisfying as they often add up to having a large impact on the whole product.

{{< box title="Communicating Complexity" class="box-green" >}}
Technical topics are not easy to talk about and decision making is a tough task. I can explain complex subjects with clarity and simplicity, allowing all involved to have a better picture of the relevant problems and solutions.

## What I Work On
I am a curious person and have many wide ranging interests and am sure to have many more. I like to learn and appreciate the world around us and what we create for it. The following are sampling of more specific things that I enjoy learning about and participating in.

### Music
I have played the French horn for 12 years. I love contributing to an ensemble of musicians, from quintets to marching bands, and admiring what beauty many can come together to accomplish. I also dabble in music composition (ask me about music notation software) and marching drill writing. (However, I don't have a ton of positives about drill writing software)

### Event Lighting
For several years, I have had the opportunity to contribute to events large and small by lighting them. I have loved learning the intricacies of the technology and art of lighting. Lighting control software is yet another realm that I have some opinions about.

### The Built Environment
Nature is pretty nice, but I really admire the things we have built and invented for our use. Architecture, urban planning, civil engineering, and transportation fascinate me with their complex problems and genius solutions. I find designing interiors, layouts, roads, and transport networks a fun challenge.
