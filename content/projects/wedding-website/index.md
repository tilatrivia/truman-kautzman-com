## Description

As many engaged couples do, my finace and I created a website to place information about our upcoming wedding. The primary purpose for the site is to publish details about our receptions and link to our registries. There is also a photo gallery with photos from while we were dating.

## Conception

As my now wife and I prepared for our wedding, I knew I wanted to make custom graphics that we could use across our printed and digital media. There are plenty of sites that will host wedding information and sell invitations too, however I thought it would be nice to put my own skills and effort into this. The vector graphics were first drawn to give to the baker for the design of the cake. These assets evolved and eventually made their way onto the website.

## Technology

This site was built with Tailwind CSS to keep the styling straightforward. The site is deployed on Google Firebase.
