## Tantacrul

Tantacrul, also know as Martin Keary, is a Youtuber who focuses on design, music, software, and music software. He caught my attention because he touches on multiple interests of mine at once. His insights about music notation software as a professional software designer and composer are very well informed and his presentation style is captivating, even if you don't really care about notation software. I of course do care bu-Sibelius crashed. As of recently, he designs a wonderful free music notation software called MuseScore.

## Mary Blair

Mary Blair was an influential modernist artist who worked directly with Walt Disney to give his films and theme park attractions incredible visuals. Think "Its a Small World," that's her visual style. Modernist art has unfortunately been often resigned to children's content. I think it is the fun side of the otherwise stoic mid-century modern style. I find her bold use of color and shape to be creative and interesting. You'll see some Mary Blair in how I designed this site.
