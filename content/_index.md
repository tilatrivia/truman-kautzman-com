## How I Work
My approach to a project focuses on quality and considerate decision making. I am diligent in seeking the best solutions to important problems. What follows are the principles I use to approach the problem-solving process.

### User Experience Design
Design refines the near endless possibilities of computing into optimal solutions. I believe software can compliment and enhance many processes, removing the rote and leaving the creative and inventive tasks for people.

### Seeing the Big Picture
I approach any problem with the overarching goals at the forefront of my mind. Seeking solutions that satisfy not just short term goals, but those related to the larger impacts and ambitions of a project.

### Refining the Smaller Details
Crossing 't's and dotting 'i's may not be most people's idea of fun, but I find tackling the minutia very satisfying as they often add up to having a large impact on the whole product.

### Communicating Complexity
Technical topics are not easy to talk about and decision making is a tough task. I can explain complex subjects with clarity and simplicity, allowing all involved to have a better picture of the relevant problems and solutions.

## What I Work On
I am a curious person and have many wide ranging interests and am sure to have many more. I like to learn and appreciate the world around us and what we create for it. The following are sampling of more specific things that I enjoy learning about and participating in.

### Music
I have played the French horn for 12 years. I love contributing to an ensemble of musicians, from quintets to marching bands, and admiring what beauty many can come together to accomplish. I also dabble in music composition (ask me about music notation software) and marching drill writing. (However, I don't have a ton of positives about drill writing software)

### Event Lighting
For several years, I have had the opportunity to contribute to events large and small by lighting them. I have loved learning the intricacies of the technology and art of lighting. Lighting control software is yet another realm that I have some opinions about.

### The Built Environment
Nature is pretty nice, but I really admire the things we have built and invented for our use. Architecture, urban planning, civil engineering, and transportation fascinate me with their complex problems and genius solutions. I find designing interiors, layouts, roads, and transport networks a fun challenge.
