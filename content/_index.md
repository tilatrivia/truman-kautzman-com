# Who is Truman Kautzman?
There are many answers to that question. I like to think I am a curious, creative, and resourceful person. I am always reflecting and developing. I identify problems and strive to solve them. I seek to understand the big picture and the impact of each detail. I hope to paint a more concrete picture of who I am with this website. Please take a look around at some of the things I have accomplished, tools I have made, and things that inspire me. Below, as a more general introduction to me, are some of my favorite facets of the world.

## Software Design
I admire software solutions in many fields. So many incredible software tools have aided in diverse domains over the last several decades. There are still innovations to be made, processes to refine, and problems to solve.

The perfectly designed tool empowers human creativity and ingenuity. Many pursuits are aided by software as computers do the repetitive, mundane work for us. What remains for us humans is new solutions to enact, art to imagine, and lives to improve.

In the domain of endless possibility, design steers us towards the ideal. A screen can have virtually any color, shape, word, or symbol on it. Data can be processed in so many diverse ways. To a degree, design is the biggest challenge.

## Music
I find it miraculous that the nature of our ears, the human brain, and physics result in simple mathematical ratios expressed in pressure waves can make us feel so strongly. That is a very complicated way of saying I like music. It is kind of crazy to think about.

I have played the French horn for twelve years of my life and played in various ensembles, from quintets to marching bands. Of the many lessons I have learned through music, that of cohesion and diversity stands out. Each instrument offers something very different to an ensemble that put together make beautiful harmonies and symphonies that are greater than the sum of their parts. This requires acceptance that each instrument has different capabilities, a tuba cannot play the same notes as a violin. Regardless, it is what they can do together that is far more important. I'm sure there are many perfectly good snare drum solos out there, but they all pale in comparison with the songs a full orchestra can produce.

## Lighting
I have now had four years of experience doing event lighting in all kinds of scenarios. With the sun in the sky, it is easy to take light for granted. Light however can move our emotions just as much as any other aspect of our environment. Like a lot of aspects of art, our experience with the real world informs our interpretation of lighting. Bright light can make us feel aware and safe, while darkness makes us blind and uncomfortable. Warm light reminds us of a warm fire while cool light reminds us of a sterile doctors office. These intuitions make lighting design decisions interesting and deliberate.

## The Built Environment
I have always felt a strong sense of place.
